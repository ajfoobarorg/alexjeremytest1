# Python Imports Rule

This rule defines the ordering of imports for Python files in the backend directory.

## Purpose

- Creates a consistent order for imports
- Makes import sections more readable
- Groups related imports together logically

## Configuration

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "patterns": [
    {
      "files": ["backend/**/*.py"],
      "rules": {
        "imports": {
          "order": [
            "standard",
            "third-party",
            "fastapi",
            "local"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Import Order

```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Third-party imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# FastAPI imports
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

# Local imports
from .models import User
from .utils import validate_input
```

## Usage Notes

- Standard library imports come first
- Third-party libraries are next
- FastAPI framework imports follow
- Local imports from the project come last
- Consistently ordered imports improve readability
