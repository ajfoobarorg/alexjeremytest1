# Python Formatter Rule

This rule enforces consistent formatting for Python files in the backend directory using Black and isort.

## Purpose

- Ensures consistent code style across the codebase
- Maintains a standard line length of 88 characters (Black default)
- Organizes imports using isort with Black-compatible settings

## Configuration

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "patterns": [
    {
      "files": ["backend/**/*.py"],
      "rules": {
        "formatters": {
          "enabled": true,
          "black": {
            "line-length": 88
          },
          "isort": {
            "profile": "black"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Notes

- This rule is applied automatically on save when `formatOnSave` is enabled
- Black is opinionated and reformats entire files to maintain consistency
- The isort profile is set to "black" to ensure compatibility between the two formatters
