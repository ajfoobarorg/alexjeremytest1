# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe API Specification

## Overview

This specification describes the API for an Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game server. The server provides functionality for user authentication, profile management, game state management, matchmaking, and gameplay.

## System Architecture

The Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe server is a RESTful API with the following components:

1. **API Layer** - Handles HTTP requests and responses, including route definitions, validation, and authentication
2. **Service Layer** - Contains business logic for game mechanics, user management, and matchmaking
3. **Data Layer** - Manages persistence of game state, user profiles, and statistics
4. **Game Logic** - Implements the rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Game Rules

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of the classic game with the following rules:

1. The game is played on a 3×3 grid of 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards (9 boards total)
2. A player's move determines which board their opponent must play in next:
   - If a player places their mark in the top-right square of any board, their opponent must play in the top-right board
   - If the board determined by the previous move is already won or full (tied), the opponent may play in any available board
3. To win the game, a player must win three boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
4. The game employs time control with each player having 6 minutes total for all their moves
5. If a player exceeds their time limit, they automatically lose the game

## Technical Requirements

1. **Database** - The implementation may use a SQLite database or any SQL-compatible database
2. **Authentication** - Simple cookie-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies
3. **Error Handling** - Standard HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
4. **Validation** - Input validation for all API endpoints
5. **Scalability** - The system should support multiple concurrent games
6. **Security** - Proper CORS configuration with secure cookie handling
7. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
